# nativescript-push-error
Demo Repository to demonstrate suspected Bug in nativescript-firebase that duplicates services.

It seems that opening a push notification in a suspended android app leads to a duplication of angular services.

The reported issue can be found here: https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-plugin-firebase/issues/1533
